# iExec Worker

## Overview

The _iExec Worker_ participates in a workerpool by computing tasks purchased by requesters on the iExec marketplace.
The _iExec Worker_ must connect to the _iExec Core Scheduler_ of the workerpool to actively participate in the computation.

After registration, the _iExec Worker_ sends a signal to the _iExec Core Scheduler_ at a fixed rate.
This signal is used to let the _iExec Core Scheduler_ be aware of the _iExec Worker_ liveness.
At the moment, the rate is fixed and this signal is sent every 10 seconds.
The _iExec Worker_ will be considered as lost after several failures.

The _iExec Worker_ is available as an OCI image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/iexec-worker/tags).

## Configuration

You can configure the _iExec Worker_ with the following properties:

| Environment variable                            | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Type                     | Default value                                               |

## Health checks

A health endpoint (`/actuator/health`) is enabled by default and can be accessed on the `IEXEC_WORKER_PORT`.
This endpoint allows to define health checks in an orchestrator or a [compose file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#healthcheck).
No default strategy has been implemented in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) at the moment.

## Metrics

A metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) is available. It currently exposes data on TEE pre-compute, app-compute and TEE post-compute durations in the following form:

```json
{
  "preComputeDurations": {
    "minDuration": 3835.0,
    "maxDuration": 3928.0,
    "averageDuration": 3881.5,
    "durationSamplesCount": 2
  },
  "appComputeDurations": {
    "minDuration": 4349.0,
    "maxDuration": 4349.0,
    "averageDuration": 4349.0,
    "durationSamplesCount": 1
  },
  "postComputeDurations": {
    "minDuration": 16080.0,
    "maxDuration": 16080.0,
    "averageDuration": 16080.0,
    "durationSamplesCount": 1
  },
  "completeComputeDurations": {
    "minDuration": 24264.0,
    "maxDuration": 24264.0,
    "averageDuration": 24264.0,
    "durationSamplesCount": 1
  }
}
```

These metrics are computed on the latest `IEXEC_WORKER_METRICS_WINDOW_SIZE` executions of each stage.

All these metrics but complete compute durations can also be exposed on `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. In such a case, they are
called `iexec_{pre_compute|app_compute|post_compute}_duration_{min|max|average|samples_count}`.

⚠ As pre-compute is optional, metrics of each stage are not consistent. E.g.: if `IEXEC_WORKER_METRICS_WINDOW_SIZE` replicates are executed, each of those replicates without any dataset nor input
file, then none of the pre-compute durations relates to any of app-compute or post-compute durations. So, treat these metrics with care.
